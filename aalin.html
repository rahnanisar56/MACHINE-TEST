    <h1><u>Kerala's Youngest Organ Donor: Ten-Month-Old Aalin Gifts Life to Four</u></h1>
    <p>In a moment of profound courage and compassion, ten-month-old Aalin Sherin Abraham from Mallappally, Pathanamthitta, became Kerala's youngest organ donor, giving new life to four individuals.
    The infant was declared brain dead at Amrita Hospital after sustaining critical injuries in a road accident on February 5 near Pallam Borma Junction on M.C. Road. </p>
    <p>Following the accident, Aalin was initially treated at hospitals in Changanassery and Thiruvalla before being shifted to Amrita Hospital, Kochi, on February 6 for advanced care.
    She had sustained multiple injuries, including a traumatic brain injury, rib and lung injury. Despite intensive medical management in the Pediatric ICU and emergency neurosurgery to relieve severe brain swelling, her condition did not improve. 
    After comprehensive evaluation and two serial brainstem death tests conducted 24 hours apart, she was declared brain dead. She was cared for in the Pediatric ICU by Dr. Sajith Kesavan and team, including Dr. Binoy and Dr. Greeshma, with neurosurgical intervention performed by Dr. Suhas Udayakumaran.</p>

    <p>In an extraordinary act of generosity amid unbearable grief, her father, Arun Abraham, and mother Sherin Ann John consented to organ donation. 
    The process was coordinated through the government's Kerala State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (K-SOTTO). Aalin's heart valve was sent to Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, her liver to KIMS Hospital, and her kidneys to Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram.
    Her eyes were donated to the Eye Bank at Amrita Hospital, Kochi. Both kidneys will be transplanted into a 10-year-old girl undergoing treatment at the Government Medical College, while a six-month-old infant will receive the liver, offering hope and healing to families awaiting a miracle.</p>
    <p>The organs were transported from Kochi to Thiruvananthapuram under a carefully coordinated green corridor facilitated by the Kerala Police. The ambulance departed Amrita Hospital at 7:15 PM and reached the state capital shortly after 10:30 PM, ensuring timely transplantation procedures. 
    Dr. Varghese Eldho from KIMS Hospital accompanied the organ transport team and Amrita Hospital staff member Jayaneesh drove the ambulance. </p>
    <p>Aalin's parents, Sherin Ann John and Arun Abraham, transformed an unimaginable tragedy into a beacon of hope for others.
    Their decision stands as a powerful testament to humanity, reminding society of the life-saving impact of organ donation. Through this selfless act, a ten-month-old child has left behind a legacy far greater than her brief life - a legacy of life, compassion, and renewed beginnings. </p>
