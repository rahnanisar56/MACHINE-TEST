<p>The blaze started on the second floor of the three-storey commercial building around 6 pm and quickly spread to the upper floors and other sections of the structure, officially said.
Four units of the Fire and Rescue Services reached the spot and began efforts to contain the fire. Additional fire engines have been deployed from different parts of the district as flames continued to spread.</p>
<p>All employees were evacuated immediately after the fire was detected. Authorities said no staff or customers are currently trapped inside the Jayalakshmi Silks building.
